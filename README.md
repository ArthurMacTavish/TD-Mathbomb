# How to play?

Head to [https://mathbomb.td.reubenhu.my.id](https://mathbomb.td.reubenhu.my.id) to play.

# The Mechanics

All you need to do is answer the math questions before the timer runs out. The more you answer, the faster the timer.

The timer resets every time you answer a question. If you ran out of time (or gives a wrong answer), the timer speed will resets back.

# Where do you got the name?

It's basically Math version of a Roblox game named [Word Bomb](https://www.roblox.com/games/2653064683/Word-Bomb).
